=======

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/librato/librato-rails.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/librato/librato-rails)

Report key statistics for your Rails app to [Librato Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com/), easily track your own custom metrics. Currently supports Rails 3.0+.

**NOTE: This is currently in alpha development and is not yet officially supported**

**NOTES FOR ALPHA TESTERS:**
 * If you are upgrading from a version prior to the rename to librato-rails, note that *the env variable names for configuration and the name of the config files have changed*. See the new names in configuration, below.
 * Starting with 0.4.0 *all metrics are now submitted as gauges*. If you were using a prior version you will need to manually remove any librato-rails generated metrics which are counters.

## Installation

In your `Gemfile` add:

    gem 'librato-rails'
    
Then run `bundle install`.

## Configuration

If you don't have a Metrics account already, [sign up](https://metrics.librato.com/). In order to send measurements to Metrics you need to provide your account credentials to `librato-rails`. You can provide these one of two ways:

Create a `config/librato.yml` like the following:

    production:
      user: <your-email>
      token: <your-api-key>
      
OR provide `LIBRATO_METRICS_USER` and `LIBRATO_METRICS_TOKEN` environment variables. If both env variables and a config file are present, environment variables will take precendence.

Note that using a configuration file allows you to specify configurations per-environment. Submission will be disabled in any environment without credentials. However, if environment variables are set they will be used in all environments. 

Full information on configuration options is available on the [configuration wiki page](https://github.com/librato/librato-rails/wiki/Configuration).

## Automatic Measurements

After installing `librato-rails` and restarting your app and you will see a number of new metrics appear in your Metrics account. These track request performance, sql queries, mail handling, and other key stats. All built-in performance metrics start with the prefix `rails` by convention &mdash; for example: `rails.request.total` is the total number of requests received during an interval. 

If you have multiple apps reporting to the same Metrics account you can change this prefix in your [configuration](https://github.com/librato/librato-rails/wiki/Configuration).

## Custom Measurements

Tracking anything that interests you is easy with Metrics. There are four primary helpers available:

#### increment

Use for tracking a running total of something _across_ requests, examples:

    # increment the 'sales_completed' metric by one
    Librato.increment 'sales_completed'
    
    # increment by five
    Librato.increment 'items_purchased', 5
    
Other things you might track this way: user signups, requests of a certain type or to a certain route, total jobs queued or processed, emails sent or received

#### measure

Use when you want to track an average value _per_-request. Examples:

    Librato.measure 'user.social_graph.nodes', 212

    Librato.measure 'jobs.queued', 3
    

#### timing

Like `Librato.measure` this is per-request, but specialized for timing information:

    Librato.timing 'twitter.lookup.time', 21.2
	
The block form auto-submits the time it took for its contents to execute as the measurement value:

    Librato.timing 'twitter.lookup.time' do
      @twitter = Twitter.lookup(user)
    end

#### group

There is also a grouping helper, to make managing nested metrics easier. So this:

    Librato.measure 'memcached.gets', 20
    Librato.measure 'memcached.sets', 2
    Librato.measure 'memcached.hits', 18
    
Can also be written as:

    Librato.group 'memcached' do |g|
      g.measure 'gets', 20
      g.measure 'sets', 2
      g.measure 'hits', 18
    end

Symbols can be used interchangably with strings for metric names.

## Cross-process Aggregation

`librato-rails` submits measurements back to the Librato platform on a
per-process basis. By default these are then aggregated in our service
up to host-level streams prior to persisting the data. For example given 
4 hosts with 8 unicorn instances each (i.e. 32 processes total),
you'll find 4 data streams (1 per host)
available in the Librato platform instead of 32. This leverages a
brand-new beta Librato capability to perform *service-side aggregation*.
Current per-measurement pricing applies after aggregation, so in this
case you're also only metered as 4 streams instead of 32.

If you would like to prevent this aggregation and preserve the
per-process measurements, you can do so by setting `source_pids=true` in
your config. Alternatively, you can also decide to perform aggregation
at an even higher level by manually configuring the source to the same
value in each process you want aggregated. E.g. if you configure a
uniform source name of `app.foo` on all of the 32 unicorn instances
described above, you'll only find in the Librato platform (and be metered
for) a single set of streams instead of 4.

## Contribution

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project and submit a pull request from a feature or bugfix branch.
* Please include tests. This is important so we don't break your changes unintentionally in a future version.
* Please don't modify the gemspec, Rakefile, version, or changelog. If you do change these files, please isolate a separate commit so we can cherry-pick around it.
